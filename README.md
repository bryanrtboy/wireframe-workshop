wireframe-workshop
==================

A 2D game development workshop using simple pencil wireframe drawings to allow the game designer to focus on core mechanics and game play. The game design is a clone of the Unity 2D game tutorial project available on the Asset Store, but the visual design has been completely removed and replaced with wireframe drawings.

All audio and code is from the Unity tutorial series located on the Unity website here: http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/2d

Usage of the scripts and audio recordings require adhering to the Unity license agreement - http://unity3d.com/legal/eula 

You are free to use the wireframe, pencil artwork for any purpose, commercial or personal, but you may not license the art for profit.
