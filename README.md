wireframe-workshop
==================

A 2D game development workshop using simple pencil wireframe drawings to allow the game designer to focus on core mechanics and game play. The game design is a clone of the Unity 2D game tutorial project available on the Asset Store, but the visual design has been completely removed and replaced with wireframe drawings.
